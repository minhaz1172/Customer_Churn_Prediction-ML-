# ðŸ“„ Bank Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting customer churn** in the banking sector using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers leave a service provider, is a critical metric in the banking industry. By identifying potential churners in advance, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and improve customer satisfaction.

##  Project Goal
- Build a predictive machine learning model to classify whether a customer will **exit (churn)** or **stay** with the bank.
- Help the bank make **data-driven decisions** for customer retention strategies.
- Analyze key factors that contribute to customer churn.

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed information about bank customers, including demographic, financial, and behavioral features.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Customer ID | Unique identifier for each customer |
| Surname | Customer's surname |
| Credit Score | Customer's credit score |
| Geography | Customer's country (France, Spain, Germany) |
| Gender | Customer's gender (Male, Female) |
| Age | Customer's age |
| Tenure | Years the customer has been with the bank |
| Balance | Customer's bank account balance |
| NumOfProducts | Number of bank products used |
| HasCrCard | Has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| IsActiveMember | Active bank member (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| EstimatedSalary | Customer's estimated salary |
| Exited | Target variable: 1 = Churned, 0 = Stayed |

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Model building and evaluation)
- Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Machine Learning Process
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding key factors that influence churn.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and transforming features for better model performance.
4. **Model Training:** Using various classification algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
6. **Insights & Recommendations:** Based on model interpretation and feature importance.

## Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience in the complete machine learning workflow.
- Importance of handling imbalanced datasets.
- Practical skills in feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

##  Project Outcome
Successfully developed a churn prediction model that helps the bank:
- Identify potential customers at risk of leaving.
- Focus marketing and retention strategies on high-risk customers.
- Improve overall customer relationship management.
